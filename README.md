This project utilizes the PetFinder API to provide a tool to search for adoptable pets in a user's chosen area. The page will load initially with a random featured pet from any area in the country. Once the user enters a zip code to search, the first 25 each of dogs and cats in that zip code will populate.

The user has the ability to route to see dogs, cats, or their favorited animals.

This application is a work in progress.

Built with React, Redux, Router.

## To Use

Clone down this repo

`npm install`

`npm start`

Enter your zip code in the search field to search for pets in your area.

The user can change search location or animal category at any time.
